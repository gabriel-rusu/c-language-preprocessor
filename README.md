<h1 align="center">C Language Preprocessor</h1>

<p align="justify"> This is a simple C/C++ preprocessor. The goal is to have good conformance with the C and C++ standards and to handle nonstandard preprocessor extensions in gcc / clang / visual studio preprocessors. Most of the preprocessor testcases in gcc and clang are handled OK by simplecpp.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
To run the preprocessor on your computer you must have:
* gcc - is a tool from the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04/) used to compile and link C programs - on **Linux**
* cl -  is a tool that controls the [Microsoft C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/compiler-options?view=vs-2019) compiler and linker - on **Windows**

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
